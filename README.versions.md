The purpose of this branch is to hold alternate versions of formulae that are
often requested. By design, Homebrew currently only maintains a single version
of a software package, typically the most recent stable release. In some cases
this release is "too new" for people to want to migrate yet. For instance,
we went to Redis 2.0.x as soon as it was declared stable, even if some people
would have preferred to stay at version 1.2.x.

This branch will be used to hold 'older versions' of software until a decision
can be reached about how to maintain multiple versions in master.


NOTE: This branch may be rebased at will.
